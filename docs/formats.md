# Hindi project formats version 1

## Configuration

`परियोजना.भाषविन्यास` uses JSON structure with Bhash's existing unquoted literals `सत्य`, `असत्य` and `रिक्त`. They decode to booleans and null. Strings containing those words remain strings. English literal spellings and alternate yes/no terms are rejected outside strings. Numbers follow JSON syntax and must be finite. Strings use JSON escapes. Configuration keys are normalized to NFC and duplicate normalized keys fail. User strings are preserved. Nesting is limited to 64 levels.

| Field | Type and constraint |
| --- | --- |
| योजना_संस्करण | Integer 1 |
| नाम | Nonempty display string up to 100 characters |
| लक्ष्य | एंड्रॉयड, डेस्कटॉप or वेब. Android is implemented. |
| ऐप_पहचान | Stable ASCII Android application ID, generated once at creation |
| न्यूनतम_एंड्रॉयड_स्तर | Integer 29 for this prototype |
| संजाल_अनुमति | Boolean. Maps to INTERNET permission when true. |
| प्रारंभिक_मान | Optional reserved application data. Parsed and preserved, with no runtime behavior yet. |

All fields except प्रारंभिक_मान are required and unknown fields fail. Omitted optional fields remain absent. Explicit रिक्त remains null. A reserved value must never silently turn into a string or a default. The editor blocks changing an existing application ID while saving.

## Screen XML

The root is `पर्दा` with `पहचान="मुख्य"` and a nonempty `शीर्षक`. It contains one `स्तंभ` or `पंक्ति`. Containers may nest. `पाठ` contains literal text. `बटन` contains a label and requires `दबानेपर` naming a Bhash handler. Optional `तर्क` supplies its string argument, defaulting to an empty string. Unknown tags and attributes fail. XML entities for literal text such as `&amp;` and `&quot;` work. DTDs, comments and declarations with `<!` are rejected. At most 200 components and 12 nested container levels are accepted.

Handlers currently use `फलन नाम(मान: पाठ) -> पाठ`. Export symbols are deterministic ASCII names assigned by traversal order within a build. They are internal implementation details. Bhash's compiler validates exported types and function resolution during compilation. The preliminary editor signature check is intentionally limited and can reject unusual formatting or accept a signature-looking comment. Full compiler validation is the build gate.

## Compatibility

The configuration is a JSON dialect and requires the studio parser. Standard JSON parsers cannot read its unquoted Hindi literals. Standard JSON or Android XML is generated only for integration. Future schema migrations must preserve application IDs, user strings and explicit null values. New schema versions must be rejected by older studios with Hindi recovery guidance before modifying files.
